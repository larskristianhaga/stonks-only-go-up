# stonks-only-go-up

An chrome extension that removes the sell button on Nordnet, since stonks only go up!

Only works on Nordnet.no due to whitelisting of domain name.

* Enable `Developer mode` using the toggle switch at the top right.
* Click `Load unpacked` and navigate to the place where you saved the repo, and select the folder `extension`.
